Week 7 Practical


Q Taylor Series

To Compile
	 
    gcc -o prac7 prac7.c -lm -Wall

To print

    ./prac7

    (-lm is to map math library to the gcc and -Wall is to show all the warnings)

On running the code it will prompt the user to enter the size of the array which it will give an output array of mentioned size. It shows the dynamic allocation of the array based on user input.


Dynamic Allocation

To Compile
	 
    gcc -o prac7_dynalloc prac7_dynalloc.c 

To print

    ./prac7_dynalloc

On running it it will prompt the user to enter the level of precision or order of polynomial of taylors series (any number) to use, after that it will print the output of sum of taylors series for x = 1.
